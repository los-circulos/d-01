decoration for the famous Super Chipmunk CL kit

Skip Volk's Super Chipmunk paint scheme was drawn from sketch. More accurate than kit manufacturer's suggested paint scheme.

Note the paint scheme is incomplete and does not include underside.

There are files to laser cut vinyls and/or use to cut/print and cut masking for paint jobs.

Please note this is a control line model with asymetric wings. A version for a symetric wing could be made using just one side and cutting its mirrored parts.

Will fit 50-55" wingspan.

Suggested material: transparent red and transparent blue over plain white (white pieces drawings not included)

## Files provided:

 - Super Chipmunk CL-decals-cut-0.1-blue.svg - blue vinyl pieces cut file
 - Super Chipmunk CL-decals-cut-0.1-red.svg - red vinyl pieces cut file
 - Super Chipmunk CL-decals-final-0.1.svg - organized vector file containing all pieces to cut aligned on an imaginary 3view, 
 - examples/ - some photos of the applied decoration (coming soon)
